We use uv for managing our Python dependencies, not pip, so when talking about Python packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use uv.

We always write Python code with 4 spaces for indentation, so when your responses include Python code, please follow those conventions.

Our team uses Notion for tracking items of work.
